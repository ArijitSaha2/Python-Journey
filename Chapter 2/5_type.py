# TYPE() FUNCTION AND TYPECASTING.
# type() function is used to find the data type of a given variable in python.

a = "20"
t = type(a)
print(t)

b = int(a)
print(b)

c = float(b)
print(c)

# A number can be converted into a string and vice versa (if possible)
# There are many functions to convert one data type into another.

# str(31)   =>"31"  # integer to string conversion
# int("32") => 32   # string to integer &onversion 
# float(32) => 32.0 # integer to float conversion
# and so, on

# Here "31 " is a string literal and 31 a numeric literal.
