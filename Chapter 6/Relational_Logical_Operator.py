# RELATIONAL OPERATORS:
"""
Relational Operators are used to evaluate conditions inside the if statements. Some examples of relational operators are:

==: equals.
>: greater than.   
<: less than.
>=: greater than or equal to.
<=: less than or equal to.
!=: not equals.

"""

# LOGICAL OPERATORS:
"""
In python logical operators operate on conditional statements. Example:
and - true if both operands are true else false.
or - true if at least one operand is true else false.
not - inverts true to false & false to true.
